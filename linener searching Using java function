linear searching 

Linear search, often known as sequential search, is the most basic search technique. In this type of search, you go through the entire list and try to fetch a match for a single element. If you find a match, then the address of the matching target element is returned. 

On the other hand, if the element is not found, then it returns a NULL value. 

Following is a step-by-step approach to perform Linear Search Algorithm.



public class Main{

  public static int linerSearch(int num[],int key){

    

    for(int i = 0;i<num.length;i++){

      if(num[i]==key){

        return i;

         

      }

    }

    return -1;

  }

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int num[]={2,4,6,7,2,8,9,10,5};

		int key = 5;

		int index = linerSearch(num,key);

		if(index==-1){

		  System.out.println("Not found");

		}

		else

		System.out.println("array element at index : "+ index);

	

	}

}
